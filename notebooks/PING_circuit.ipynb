    "This tutorial provides a simple example of how to use the Neuroblox package to simulate a [pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) network](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/17/3/557/6926/Effects-of-Noisy-Drive-on-Rhythms-in-Networks-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext).\n",

    "# Conceptual definition\n",
    "The PING network is a simple model of a cortical network that consists of two populations of neurons: excitatory and inhibitory.\n",
    "We omit the detailed equations of the neurons here, but note they are Hodgkin-Huxley-like equations with a few modifications.\n",
    "Excitatory neurons are reduced Traub-Miles cells [2] and inhibitory neurons are Wang-Buzasaki cells [3].\n",
    "Both follow Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, i.e., the membrane voltage is governed by the sum of the currents through the sodium, potassium, and leak channels, along with external drive, such that:\n",
    "$$ C \\frac{dV}{dt} = g_{\\text{Na}} m^3 h (V_{\\text{Na}} - V) + g_\\text{K} n^4 (V_\\text{K} - V) + g_\\text{L} (V_\\text{L} - V) + I_{\\text{ext}} $$\n",
