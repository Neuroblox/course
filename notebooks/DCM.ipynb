    "Neuroblox provides you with a comprehensive environment for simulations as we have explored previously, but its functionality doesn't stop there.\n",
    "We will now pivot and turn our attention to a different kind of problem:\n",
    "inferring model parameters, that is solving inverse problems, from time series.\n",
    "The method of choice is one of the most widely spread in imaging neuroscience, spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling (spDCM)[1,2].\n",
    "In this tutorial we will introduce how to perform a spDCM analysis on simulated data.\n",
    "To do so we roughly reproduce the procedure in the [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) script `DEM_demo_induced_fMRI.m` in [Neuroblox](https://www.neuroblox.org/).\n",
    "This work was also presented in Hofmann et al.[2]\n",

    "In this session we will define a circuit of three linear neuronal mass models, all driven by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n",
    "We will model fMRI data by a balloon model and BOLD signal on top.\n",

    "- **Explore susceptibility with respect to noise.** Run the script again with a different random seed and observe how the results change. Given that we didn’t change any parameters of the ground truth, what is your take on parameter inference with this setup? How reliable is model selection based on free energy (compare the different free energies of the models and their respective parameter values with ground truth)?\n",
    "- **Averaging over patients.** Now repeat the simulation and inference again with 10 different seeds (you can just remove the number in Random.seed() to use current time stamps as seeds) and store the results of each run, such that you get several models based on the same ground truth but with different instances of the noise. Can you extract the average value of the effective connectivity from the ensemble?\n",
    "- Changing neuronal dynamics model. Now change the model and test the whole procedure with a different underlying neuronal mass model, for instance the Jansen-Rit model. Note that there are no default priors for the Jansen-Rit model, you will have to provide priors for the extra parameters or remove them from the optimization procedure by setting their tunable to false."
