    "- **Explore susceptibility with respect to noise.** Run the script again with a different random seed and observe how the results change. Given that we didn’t change any parameters of the ground truth, what is your take on parameter inference with this setup? How reliable is model selection based on free energy (compare the different free energies of the models and their respective parameter values with ground truth)?\n",
    "- **Averaging over patients.** Now repeat the simulation and inference again with 10 different seeds (you can just remove the number in Random.seed() to use current time stamps as seeds) and store the results of each run, such that you get several models based on the same ground truth but with different instances of the noise. Can you extract the average value of the effective connectivity from the ensemble?\n",
    "- Changing neuronal dynamics model. Now change the model and test the whole procedure with a different underlying neuronal mass model, for instance the Jansen-Rit model. Note that there are no default priors for the Jansen-Rit model, you will have to provide priors for the extra parameters or remove them from the optimization procedure by setting their tunable to false."
