@parameters lnκ=0.0 [tunable=false] lnϵ=0.0 [tunable=false] lnτ=0.0 [tunable=false]   # lnκ: decay parameter for hemodynamics; lnϵ: ratio of intra- to extra-vascular components, lnτ: transit time scale
@parameters C=1/16 [tunable=false]   # note that C=1/16 is taken from SPM12 and stabilizes the balloon model simulation. See also comment above.
