# Plotting with Makie

Makie is a plotting ecosystem based in Julia. It comes with multiple backends for rendering and displaying plots. For this course we will be using `CairoMakie` as it has a lot of features for 2D static plots and most computers should support it as it only requires a CPU and no GPU.

Makie has a great [Getting Started page](https://docs.makie.org/stable/tutorials/getting-started) to familiarize yourselves with some basic plotting functions and labelling options.
