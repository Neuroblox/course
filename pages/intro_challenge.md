# Julia Challenge Problems

- Define a [Generalized Integrate-and-Fire neuron](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Pt2.html) as an `ODESystem` and simulate it. 
- Write a function that plots a Peristimulus Time Histogram (PSTH) [reference]
- Pick a neuron model of your choice and perform a sensitivity analysis on the system. How is its spiking behavior change as its parameters change? Summarize the results in one (or several) plots.
