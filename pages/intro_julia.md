## Notebooks

We will work on two Jupyter notebooks 
- `julia_intro.ipnyb` : getting started with Julia, please start here.
- `julia_types_and_multiple_dispatch.ipnyb` : custom types and multiple dispatch.

These notebooks were contributed by George Datseris as part of the Zero-to-Hero Julia workshop and are kindly available as an open repository. For more details on that workshop please check :
